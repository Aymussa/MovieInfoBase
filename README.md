# Description/ About The Project 

This is a web based application that allows the users to search for movies of their choice with a count API to log the numver of visits to the website. 

It is based on the OMDB API with a few minor modifications to give a summarised view of the information for the user displayed. This includes the movie title, cast, director, Certification, run time and year the movie was released. 



## Built with 
1. Bootstrap
2. CSS framework
3. JQuery
4. HTML, CSS and JS
5. OMDB API
6. CountAPI
7. Figma
8. Google powerpoint 

The above technologies were used in the project and allowed us to demonstrate what was required of us to complete the project. 

We created a slack channel to make it easy for us to communicate with each other and tasks were assigned on a voluntary basis. each member of the team volunteered to take on a task. 


### Getting started 

1. Create a repository and clone it to your local computer

2. Get a free API Key at .....
3. Enter your API in config.js

## Usage 

## challenges 
The main challenge faced during the project was resolving merge conflicts as this was new to us. Other challenges include learning to collaborate on github, using figma and finding time outside of class to work on the project.
